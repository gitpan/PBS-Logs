PBS-Logs version 0.02
=====================

PBS::Logs - general parser for PBS log files

This module is designed to read the voluminous set of event or accounting
log files produced by a PBS (Portable Batch System) server.  These log
files typically have a filename which contain a datestamp (e.g. YYYYMMDD)
and which directory they are found in indicates their function.

The log file format has two formats:
 1) Accounting logs of the form -
	datetime;record_type;id;message

 2) Event logs of the form -
	datetime;event_code;server_name;object_type;object_name;message

The details as to the format and meaning can be found in the
"PBS Pro 5.4 Administrator Guide", and some info can be found
within this module.

The modules can filter on datetime and/or record_type and the class
methods can retrieve the data in a variety of formats (arrays, hashes,
or references of same).
